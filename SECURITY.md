# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred), so we can coordinate a private fix and disclosure timeline.

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, contact the maintainers via the repository contact listed on the project page.

Please do not open public issues for security reports.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release line and the `master` branch. Older releases are not guaranteed to receive fixes.

## Disclosure Timeline

We aim to acknowledge reports within a few business days and provide a remediation plan as quickly as possible.
